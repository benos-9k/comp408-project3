Fork of PBRT v2 for COMP 408 at VUW.
Not really a fork because of build system changes and removing all but the renderer source.

PBRT for COMP 408
=================

This is just the PBRT renderer (no tools / exporters), with a CMake build system.
The `cmake` branch has the CMake and unmodified pbrt-v2 source.
